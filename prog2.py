# Program 2: Guess the number
# Generate 1 random number (0-100)
# Ask the user to guess the number
# Display “Greater than” if the inputed number is greater than the random number
# Display “Less than” if the inputed number is less than the random number
# Repeat asking the user until the random number has been guessed correctly.
